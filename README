Light 0.4
---------

 - Description ---

"Light" is a program to control backlight-controllers in GNU/Linux-systems. It is the successor of "LightScript",
which is a bash-script with the same purpose, and tries to maintain the same functionality.

It features:

	* Works excellent where other software has proven unusable/problematic(xbacklight etc) thanks to how
	  it operates internally.

	* Automatically figures out the best controller to use depending on its resolution, making full use
	  of the underlying hardware. 

	* Written in ANSI C89 - which practically makes it as portable as a program can be, with the exception
	  of the glibc-dependency.


 - Usage ---

Executed without arguments, light prints usage-information that is pretty self-explanatory.

Examples:

	Set brightness to 40 percent:
	light 40

	Increase brightness with 10% and supress output:
	light -aq 10	

	Print the maximum-brightness of the best controller and exit:
	light -m


 - Installation ---

	1. Install the neccesary buildtools (make, gcc etc)

	2. Type "make stable"

	3. Success? Copy/symlink the "light"-executable to /usr/bin.

	4. Enjoy!
