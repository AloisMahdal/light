 - Description ---

"Light" is a program to control backlight-controllers in GNU/Linux-systems. It is the successor of "LightScript",
which is a bash-script with the same purpose, and tries to maintain the same functionality.

It features:

	* Works excellent where other software has proven unusable/problematic(xbacklight etc) thanks to how
	  it operates internally, and the fact that it doesn't need X. 

	* Automatically figures out the best controller to use depending on its resolution, making full use
	  of the underlying hardware, if you have a "bad system" the controller to use is overridable by the
	  /etc/light/override-file

	* Written in ANSI-C89 -- which practically makes it as portable as a program can be, with the exception
	  of the glibc-dependency.

	* Has a default minimumcap of 5% brightness, easily changeable in /etc/light/minlight. This to prevent
	  screens from turning pitchblack, since some controllers do that on 0 brightness.

 - Usage ---

Executed without arguments, light prints usage-information that is pretty self-explanatory.

Examples:

	Set brightness to 40 percent:
	light 40

	Increase brightness with 10% and supress output:
	light -aq 10	

	Print the maximum-brightness of the best controller and exit:
	light -m


 - Installation ---

	1. Install the neccesary buildtools (make, gcc etc)

	2. Type "make stable"

	3. Optionally make the light-binary executable by regular users by running makeexec.sh as root
	
	4. Create a symbolic link to /usr/bin
	
	5. Enjoy!

	Optional:
	
	6. Create /etc/light/minlight to set a minimumcap (5 is good for highresolution controllers)
